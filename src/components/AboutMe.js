      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>My Background:</h3>
      <p>I'm a graduate of Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Health and
          Human Sciences, with a concentration of Pre-Physician Assistant (PA) and a minor in Psychology. I have been
          working in the healthcare field as a Physical Therapy Technician for the past 6 years but have recently
          decided to make a transition out of healthcare and into the world of software and technology. During my
          first two years of undergrad at Purdue I was introduced to coding and Python. Over the past year as I've
          been searching to make a career change I remembered back to those days of coding and the joy I found
          while doing it.</p>
      <h3>Where I am Now:</h3>
      <p>I have since started my own self education starting with HTML, CSS, Python and Java and am eager to
          continue down this path of education and to understand the entire software development lifecycle. I am currently
          a student at Flatiron School, working to complete their Software Engineering bootcamp. Once I complete
          this bootcamp I will be searching for employment as a developer in the DMV area. I am a hardworking and
          determined person and very excited to break into this industry!</p>
      <h3>For Fun:</h3>
      <p>Outside of work I enjoy cooking and playing soccer. I volunteer as a youth coach in my area as I want to
          continue to spread to knowledge of the game to as many children as I can. I also still play any time I
          get the chance.</p>
